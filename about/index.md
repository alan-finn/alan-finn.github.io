I've been in IT for 20 years (give or take).  This site is mainly where I post some write ups for my own referral later but I do hope they help you out as well. I've been using Wordpress for this for several years, but got tired of the updates and extra work that goes with the CMS platforms as well as the Linux/MySQL platform support; that's like work outside of work. I wanted to try something new so moved over to a static web site to trim things down. The performance is substantially improved and it's much easier to maintain; I'm digging it.
